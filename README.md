- Complete implementation of BST in two languages: Java and Racket
- Important Alrogithms: Findmin, remove, add, in-order (print all the elements in a BST in order)
- Learned Principles: How to manipulate and use the structure of a BST to perform tasks.
- Challenges: Implementing add and remove where challenging, and required a concrete understanding of algorithm design to implement each method.
